Experiments Code.

Link to task : https://gitlab.com/NLP4IF/nlp4if-2021

### Instructions to train on colab + vscode

```
[Run below in colab notebook first, ensure runtime is selected as GPU]

!pip install colabcode
from colabcode import ColabCode
ColabCode(port=10000, password="bowbow123")

[Go to the link generated by the cell]
[File->Terminal->New-Terminal]
[In the terminal, enter below code]

git clone https://github.com/shreyas-kowshik/nlp4if.git
cd nlp4if
bash setup.sh

[Run this command]
roberta_train.py -bs 32 -lr 5e-5 -lr_emb 5e-6 -e 60 -wdbr ensemble_aug_inverse_weights_roberta_small -model roberta_attn_classwise --base roberta-base --save_model True
```


### Wandb installation

```
pip install wandb

wandb login
```

Go over to the link in terminal and paste you API key. That should be it.

### NOTES
- Orignal Bulgarian and Arabic datasets have column name 'tweet' instead of 'tweet_text'. To maintain uniformity, Arabic and Bulgarian datasets have their column name 'tweet' replaced by 'tweet_text'. These new datasets have the following naming convention: ORIGINAL_NAME+'_mod.tsv'

### To Do
- For running models with Bulgarian and Arabic datasets, the lines ```TRAIN_FILE=args.data_train_path#+"covid19_disinfo_binary_english_train.tsv"
DEV_FILE=args.data_dev_path#+"covid19_disinfo_binary_english_dev_input.tsv"```
need to be replaced with corresponding file paths for Bulgarian and Arabic
